Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class is simply one for a surgical robot that assists in performing surgeries. As a student highly interested in the application of computer science to medical technology, I decided to try building somthing that simulates my interest in healthcare. I plan to extend it into my final project, which will involve a simple game in which the user instructs the robot intelligently on the surgeries to perform. I would love to know your thoughts on this.

The additional methods include

an extra walk function--- overloads the walk based on direction provided in teh contract to allow for coordinates.
