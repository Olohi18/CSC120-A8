Surgical Assistant
if item in functions: tell me the function of the item
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Questions:
Is there a way to add more than one? putAll? Would love to overload addFunctions to allow many at once.
What did you say about taking note of when using nextLine?
How do I retrieve this.size after overwriting it? Thought of hard coding initially
